** Information System **
The resources that enable the collection, management, control, and dissemination of information throughout an organization.

1. A computer-based information system includes:
   database, database software, application software, computer hardware, and personnel using and developing the system.

2. Stages in the lifecycle of an information system include: 
   planning, requirements collection and analysis, design, prototyping, implementation, testing, conversion, and operational maintenance.

## Stages of the database system development lifecycle are 
   NOT strictly sequential BUT involve some amount of repetition of previous stages through feedback loops.

** System Definition **
Describes the scope and boundaries of the database system and the major user views.

** User Views **
Defines what is required of a database system from the perspective of a particular job role (such as Manager or Supervisor) 
or enterprise application area (such as marketing, personnel, or stock control).

## Requirements Collection and Analysis ##
1. Include, for example, Structured Analysis and Design (SAD) techniques, Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) and Unified Modeling Language (UML).

2. Three main approaches to managing the requirements of a database system with multiple user views:
  • the centralized approach;
  • the view integration approach;
  • a combination of both approaches.

** Database Design **
The process of creating a design that will support the enterprise’s mission statement and mission objectives for the required database system.

Approaches to Database Design
  • Bottom-up approach: 
    begins at the fundamental level of attributes (that is, properties of entities and relationships.
  # Appropriate for the design of simple databases with a relatively small number of attributes.
  # difficult to establish all the functional dependencies between the attributes of complex database.
    
  • Top-down approach: 
    illustrated using the concepts of the Entity-Relationship (ER) model,
    beginning with the identification of entities and relationships between the entities.

** Data Modeling **
Building a data model requires answering questions about entities, relationships, and attributes.
1. Two main purposes of data modeling:
  • Assist in the understanding of theCmeaning (semantics) of the data.
  • Facilitate communication about the information requirements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** Phases of Database Design **
Three main phases: conceptual, logical, and physical design.

1. Conceptual database design
   The process of constructing a model of the data used in an enterprise, independent of all physical considerations.
## Entirely independent of implementation details such as the target DBMS software, programming languages or hardware platfor ##

2. Logical database design
   The process of constructing a model of the data used in an enterprise based on a specific data model
   But independent of a particular DBMS and other physical considerations.
## know that the DBMS is, for example, relational, network, hierarchical, or object-oriented. 
## However, we ignore any other aspects or any physical details, such as storage structures or indexes.
## The technique of normalization is used to test the correctness of a logical data model.

3. Physical database design
   The process of producing a description of the implementation of the database on secondary storage; 
   It describes the base relations, file organizations, and indexes used;
   To achieve efficient access to the data, and any associated integrity constraints and security measures.
## During which the designer decides how the database is to be implemented.
## eg. creating a set of relational tables and the constraints on these tables;
       identifying the specific storage structures and access methods for the data;
       designing security protection for the system.

** Transactions **
• Retrieval transactions
  eg. operation to search for and display the details of a property (given the property number)
• Update transactions
  eg. insert new records, delete old records, or modify existing records in the database.
• Mixed transactions 
  eg. operation to search for and display the details of a property and then update the value of the monthly rent.

** Computer-Aided Software engineering (CASE) **
Applies to any tool that supports software development and permits the database system development activities to be carried out as efficiently and effectively as possible.
CASE tools may be divided into three categories: upper-CASE, lower-CASE, and integrated-CASE.
